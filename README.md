# text-adventure-2
The not very long awaited sequel to the text adventure game. It's an open world game!

If you want the music version, look for a release titled "(version name)music".
Download the music files here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kA_W0pYI8Wrga0eJcbJdjjoWGA6yBoIp/view?usp=sharing
Once installed, put them all in a folder called "sound". Put this folder with all of the other python files.
Install pyaudio by putting "py -m pip install pyaudio" into your command prompt. (install pip and python before you do this).
Everything should work!

If you don't want the music version, look for releases titled "(version name)".
