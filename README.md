# text-adventure-2
The not very long awaited sequel to the text adventure game. It's an open world game!

If you want the music version, look for a release titled "(version name)music".
Download the music files here -
Once installed, put them all in a folder called "sound". Put this folder with all of the other python files.
Install pyaudio by putting "py -m pip install pyaudio" (install pip and pythong before you do this).
Everything should work!

If you don't want the music version, look for releases titled "(version name)".
